### About Me:
My name is Marlie Martinez and I am a Jr. Software Developer working in the Bronx, NY. Prior to my employment, I was a fellow at the Knowledge House, which is where I learned Web Development. In my time there, I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, to create projects such as a web based game called Knights of JavaScript, a meme generator with the use of an API, and a simple crud application that uses a MongoDB database. To view some of my projects and their repos, check out my [portfolio]! Outside of software development, my interests include music production, gardening and learning new things.
